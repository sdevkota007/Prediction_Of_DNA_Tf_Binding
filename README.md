# Prediction Of DNA Tf Binding

The main task at hand is that, given a dataset containing samples of positive and negative protein 
binding site sequences, different neural network architectures are to be constructed 
to classify the sequences based on whether transcription factors binds to given DNA sequences.

To run the project, create a virtual environment with python3 and install the requirements using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
